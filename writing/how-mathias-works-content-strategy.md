title: How I Work, Content Strategy
description: Much of my work has been untangling and organizing enterprise content strategies. From Government to Fortune 500, making sure that content is clear, easy to understand, and meets your readers where they are at is always a winning strategy. I mix it up with my experience as a developer who understands how to implement some neat technical content strategies as well!

<p class="lead-p">
    My case studies are intentionally light to allow for easy to digest snapshots. They highlight key moments where my design, research, or leadership made an impact, showing how I tackle complex problems simply. A throughline of all my work is organizing large swaths of content, tailoring them to our audiences, and making them findable and accessible.

## General themes
I built some very early versions of design systems as Front-end Developer and Digital Strategist. When Brad Frost was writing about Atomic Design I was building it for many of my clients. I leveraged Sitecore and Adobe Experience Manager which had really great abilities to serve up personalized content to individuals which meant that the organization of content required atomic thinking as well. This allowed us to serve appropriate and approachable content through mediums. 

Content strategies are only as good as the ability to implement them. I also spend a lot of my time working with content specialists and developers to create tools to meet organization goals.

## Government Experience
Much of my work from 2020 - 2025 was within government. Our goal was to create trustworthy and authoritative content. Based on who we were, we had extra levers to pull when it came to Search Engine Optimization.

### Findsupport(dot)gov
Plain language content strategy to support people with issues related to Mental Health, Substance Use, and Opioid Use.  Built from 2022 through 2023 with ongoing support to current. Translated in both English and Spanish. Partnered with Google to better understand how LLMs and recommendations could be tailored. Many top level responses in generative AI seems to be pulling from our work.

### Federal Reserve
At the Federal Reserve, I led a content and digital strategy that helped the institution better communicate with the public as part of a broader rebrand. I partnered across teams to create scalable content strategy to support a 30+ year archive of economic research and educational content. By streamlining content workflows, introducing interactive wireframing tools to reduce miscommunication between design and development, and ensuring consistency across platforms, we accelerated delivery, improved coordination, and made it easier for content authors and developers to serve the Bankâ€™s diverse audiences.
