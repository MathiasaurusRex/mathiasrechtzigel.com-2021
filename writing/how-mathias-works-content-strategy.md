title: How I Work, Content Strategy
description: Much of my work has been untangling and organizing enterprise content strategies. From Government to Fortune 500, making sure that content is clear, easy to understand, and meets your readers where they are at is always a winning strategy. I mix it up with my experience as a developer who understands how to implement some neat technical content strategies as well!

<p class="note-p">ðŸ‘‹ I'm currently curating a portfolio of past work as I explore new opportunities. Thank you for taking the time to review it.</p>


<p class="lead-p">
    My case studies are intentionally light to allow for easy-to-digest snapshots. They highlight key moments where my design, research, or leadership made an impact, showing how I tackle complex problems simply. A throughline of all my work is organizing large swaths of content, tailoring it to audiences, and making it findable and accessible.

## General Themes
Iâ€™ve long built scalable content systems, starting as a Front-end Developer and Digital Strategist and working with tools like Sitecore and Adobe Experience Manager. While Brad Frost was writing about Atomic Design, I was building it in practice, organizing content to be personalized, reusable, and adaptable across channels.

Good strategy only works when itâ€™s implemented well. I collaborate closely with developers and content teams to ensure tools, workflows, and governance support sustainable publishing and measurable outcomes.

Some core principles I follow:

* **Center on user journeys**: Align content to real-life events so it shows up when people need it.  
* **Treat content like data**: Use structure and taxonomy to support reuse, filtering, and personalization.  
* **Support governance**: Clean up, style guide, and train to ensure quality and sustainability.  
* **Measure what matters**: Use qualitative and quantitative methods to guide iteration.


## Government Experience
Much of my work from 2020â€“2025 was within government. Our goal was to create trustworthy, authoritative content. Given our status, we could even contact companies like Google directly in case of emergency.

### Findsupport.gov
Plain language content strategy to support people dealing with mental health, substance use, and opioid use issues. Built between 2022 and 2023, with ongoing support today. The site is available in both English and Spanish. We partnered with Google to explore how LLMs and recommendations could be tailored. Many top-level responses in generative AI appear to draw from our work.

### Federal Reserve
At the Federal Reserve, I led content and digital strategy to help the institution better communicate with the public as part of a broader rebrand. I partnered across teams to create scalable content strategies that supported a 30+ year archive of economic research and educational content. By streamlining workflows, introducing interactive wireframing tools, and ensuring cross-platform consistency, we accelerated delivery and made it easier for authors and developers to serve the Bankâ€™s diverse audiences.

## Education

### Prime Digital Academy
While facilitating group learning at Prime Digital Academy, I also reorganized their 18-week curriculum to make it easier to reconfigure. We used Notion and created content fragments within its database. This allowed us to quickly assemble new programs by picking and choosing reusable modules. Update once, push everywhere.

## Private Industry

### Masterbrand Cabinets
**One-to-many: How do we create a central content strategy for many brands?**  
Masterbrand Cabinets is the parent brand for 8+ subsidiary brands. We conducted a content audit and information architecture review to support a shift to a centralized publishing platform. This let us deploy microsites for individual hardware stores selling Masterbrand products.

**While the case study is brief, you can view the final product in my [Masterbrand case study](https://mathiasrechtzigel.com/work/masterbrand).**

### X-Rite
**Managing internationalization at scale**  
X-Rite required us to translate individual pages into 14 languages across multiple regions. This meant carefully managing both our information architecture and the coordination process with translation teams, ensuring consistency and organization throughout.
