title: How I Work - Content Strategy
description: Much of my work has been untangling and organizing enterprise content strategies. From Government to Fortune 500, making sure that content is clear, easy to understand, and meets your readers where they are at is always a winning strategy. I mix it up with my experience as a developer who understands how to implement some neat technical content strategies as well!

    My case studies are intentionally light to allow for easy to digest snapshots. They highlight key moments where my design, research, or leadership made an impact, showing how I tackle complex problems simply. A throughline of all my work is organizing large swaths of content, tailoring them to our audiences, and making them findable and accessible.
