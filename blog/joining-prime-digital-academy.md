After the long (and continuing) pandemic I decided to take a break from my work-life for the summer and focus on uncovering my own personal values and align them with the next step of my career.
</p>

The summer was a relaxing one; bonding with my one year old son, biking, and catching up on a stack of books. I was also able to reconnect with many of those who I have worked with over the years and get their trusted perspectives (while also enjoying some together time post-vaccination). After many cups of coffee, patio beers, and pavilion grill outs, what I have enjoyed most about my career has been a pendulum that swings between <a href="/work" target="_blank">Leading high visibility and complex projects”</a> and <a href="/work/genesys-works/" target="_blank">“Helping others grow professionally”</a>.

While I have worked on many high visibility and impactful projects, some of my best memories come from my short stint at <a href="/work/genesys-works/" target="_blank">Genesys Works(GW)</a>. During my time with GW I connected with young professionals and helped them take their first steps into the business and technology world. Coming from a small family farm in rural Minnesota, I have personally experienced how a career in technology can change the trajectory of my own financial future and I was glad to play my small part helping others onto that path.

Working directly with these young professionals I also saw how financial systems are failing folks who might identify as coming from historically excluded groups. Bank websites who only serve content in English for First generation Americans who may have felt more comfortable making long term financial decisions if the web content was presented in their native tongue. A website that listed financial planners who don’t represent the community in which they were located. The list went on, and on.

The five years since that transformative summer I committed to becoming a better technologist and user-centered professional with a focus on always connecting with those we serve.

During my time with U.S. Bank I spent time learning with amazingly talented accessibility professionals and dove head first into making their highest profile websites exceed the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines for Super Bowl LII. During my time with the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and The Department of the Treasury I committed to ensuring that all of my projects that I started improved the lives of the public by transforming how government uses technology by designing with direct feedback from the american public so that we could modernize our websites and meet the expectations that were being elevated by the private sector.

I believe the designed space should just work. I believe that everyone deserves access, I believe that everyone can have the agency to live life unencumbered by restrictions created by historical disenfranchisement. I believe that the designed space should just work. I believe that we can, and should, do more to lift up everyone.

To align my career with these beliefs I’m excited to announce the next step will be at <a href="https://www.primeacademy.io/" target="_blank">Prime Digital Academy</a> as a <a href="https://www.primeacademy.io/courses/ux" target="_blank">Lead User Experience Instructor</a>.

I hope to bring my decade plus of experience and help guide the next generation of User Experience professionals. To help them create a future where digital services meet the demands and expectations of both customers and the public. Where websites are quick, easy, secure, and accessible and built on a foundation that is both aspirational in the long term and actionable in the short term. To help them gain marketable skills that allow them to build a sustainable and rewarding career.

During my journey I may not have gotten everything right along the way, I’m excited to help others as they take the first step on theirs.
