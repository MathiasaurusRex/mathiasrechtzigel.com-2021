I'm a developer, designer and leader who has been building for over a decade. I pride myself in creating websites that are accessible, performant and usable. In addition I have also spent much of my career building profitable digital teams for small and large digital agencies, Fortune 100 companies, and government institutions. The core of each of these teams has been the principles of support and sustainability.
