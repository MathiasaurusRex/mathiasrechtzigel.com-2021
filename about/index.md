<p class="lead-p">I am a creative technologist and system level thinker. Focused on building websites that serve everyone.  I have over a decade of experience creating websites that are accessible, performant and usable.</p>
<p class="lead-p">Although I'm <strike>good</strike> <strike>great</strike> <strike>amazing</strike> pretty decent at slinging code and pushing pixels; most of my time is spent with organizational partners. Measuring twice and cutting once works well with wood but when the systems your touching have deep roots sometimes you need to bolster organizational foundations to create more inclusive experiences.</p>
<p class="lead-p"> To ensure that these foundations don't crumble I ensure that when we build digital teams around it that they are are both sustainable by business objectives and balanced with young professionals and folks they can learn from. So that the team can grow in ways that are meaningful for both their personal development while aligning to business objectives. </p> 
<p class="lead-p">I might not always do these thing right, but the journey is learning.</p>
