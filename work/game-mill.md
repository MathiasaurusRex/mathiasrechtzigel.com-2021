## Technical Aspirations
The original website was built using NextJS and a Headless instance of Wordpress. The long term plan was to use the main Gamemill.com platform as the central hub for content and that content could then be used for marketing sites for the individual product launches. That future never quite materialized but the foundation is still there for when it makes sense for the business to make that jump.
