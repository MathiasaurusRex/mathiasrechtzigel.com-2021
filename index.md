<hr>
<p class="lead-p">Working at the intersection of product design and technology, I have influenced digital systems that 
are used by millions of people across retail, agriculture, healthcare, banking, nonprofits and government. These include 
The General Service Administration, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, the U.S Department of the Treasury, United Health Care, United Health Group, U.S. Bank, Best Buy, CHS Inc, and <a href="/work">many more</a>.</p>
<p class="lead-p">At the core of my work I strive to lay accessible, equitable, and sustainable foundations that run 
deep. More than just code, more than just design, I strive to place the people we serve at the center of everything we 
do.</p>
